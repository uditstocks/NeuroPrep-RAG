# NeuroPrep-RAG
RAG-based AI system that generates interview questions and answers grounded strictly in document context.

# Why This Matters
*Most interview generators:*
- Ask generic questions
- Ignore source material
- Hallucinate answers

*This system:*
- Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Grounds every answer in the uploaded document
- Produces consistent, explainable outputs
